# Encoded-Laser-and-Infrared-Serial-Communication

This is an arduino library which enables you to use a simple laser or LED to send characters between two arduinos (transmitter arduino with the laser to receiver arduino with a photodiode). The pin connection setup is explained in the example skethes included in the library.

How it works:
1. The data is encoded via hamming encoding (but not encrypted) to add some robustness to noise
2. it is then modulated via manchester modulation and sent via the laser or LED
3. the received signal is manchester-demodulated
4. the demodulated signal is then hamming decoded
5. the data is then printed on the serial window

What you need:
- 2 x arduinos with USB cables
- 2 x computers, one per arduino
- male to male and male to female jumper leads
- 1 x KY-008 laser module
- 1 x laser sensor module, non-modulated
- 1 x mini breadboard for photo-receiver / photodiode

How to install:
- download this library and add it to your libraries folder in the arduino folders on your computers

How to use:
1. open the arduino application
2. open File -> Examples -> HT_LumenWire and select either the photoreceiver or transmitter examples
3. plug in the arduino and select the appropriate COM port, then upload the transmitter / receiver sketches to their respective arduinos
4. connect the components as described in the sketches
5. open the serial window (spyglass symbol in the IDE) on both computers
6. point the laser or LED to the photodiode
7. enter a character or phrase in the serial window on the computer doing the transmitting and press enter to send
8. you should receive the message on the receiver serial window automatically

Extras:
- You can also set the bitrate via the .set_speed(...) function. It must be a minimum of 500 bits/sec but no more than the laser slew rate. You will need to set the speed manually into both the transmitter and receiver codes. In a later version I plan to modify the code so that you only set the speed on the transmitter end and the receiver will automatically calculate the bitrate based on the interval between received bits.
